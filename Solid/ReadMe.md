# Overview of SOLID Principles

SOLID is a set of five design principles that help create more maintainable, scalable, and robust object-oriented code. Introduced by Robert C. Martin, these principles guide developers to build systems that are easier to manage and extend over time.

## S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Definition**: A class should have only one responsibility or reason to change. This principle ensures that a class focuses on a single task, making it easier to understand and maintain.

*Example*: A class that manages user data should not also handle logging or database management.

For more details and examples, see the [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](SingleResponsibilityPrinciple/ReadMe.md).

## O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Definition**: Software entities (like classes or functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can add new functionality without changing existing code.

*Example*: A class designed to handle various types of reports can be extended to handle new report types without altering the existing code.

For more details and examples, see the [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](OpenClosePrinciple/ReadMe.md).

## L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This ensures that subclasses extend the behavior of a base class without altering its intended functionality.

*Example*: If a base class `Bird` has a method `fly()`, any subclass should either support `fly()` or override it meaningfully without breaking functionality.

For more details and examples, see the [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple/ReadMe.md).

## I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Definition**: Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use. This principle advocates for creating smaller, more specific interfaces rather than one large interface.

*Example*: Instead of a single `Worker` interface with methods for working, eating, and sleeping, create separate interfaces like `Workable` and `Eatable` to ensure classes implement only the methods they need.

For more details and examples, see the [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](InterfaceSegregationPrinciple/ReadMe.md).

## D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. In simpler terms, invert the direction of dependencies.

*Example*: A high-level service class should depend on an interface for data access rather than a concrete implementation. This allows you to change the data access details without affecting the service class.

For more details and examples, see the [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](DependencyInversionPrinciple/ReadMe.md).

Applying these SOLID principles helps create software that is easier to extend, maintain, and manage, leading to better overall design and development practices.
